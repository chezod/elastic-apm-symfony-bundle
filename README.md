This bundle integrates the Elastic APM PHP API into Symfony. For more information about Elastic APM, please visit https://www.elastic.co/apm. This bundle adds a lot more essentials. Here's a quick list:

1. **Better transaction naming strategy**: Your transaction traces can be named accurately by route names, the controller name, the request URI or you can decide on a custom naming strategy via a seamless interface that uses any naming convention you deem fit. While running console commands, it also sets the transaction name as the command name.

2. **Console Commands Enhancements**: While running console commands, its sets the options and arguments passed via the CLI as custom parameters to the transaction trace for easier debugging.

3. **Exception Listening**: It also captures all Symfony exceptions in web requests and console commands and sends them to Elastic APM.

4. **Interactor Service**: It provides access to most of the Elastic APM API via a Service class `ElasticApmInteractorInterface::class`. This can be injected it into any class, controller, service to communicate with APM. If the `adaptive` interactive is used then any APM calls will be ignored when the extension isn't loaded (for example in development environments).

    ```php
    $this->apm->addLabel('name', 'john');
    ```

5. **Logging Support**: In development, you are unlikely to have Elastic APM setup. There's a configuration to enable logging which outputs all actions to your Symfony log, hence emulating what it would actually do in production.


## Installation

### Step 0 : Install Elastic APM

Follow https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/php/current/intro.html.

### Step 1: Add dependency

```bash
$ composer require myschoolmanagement/elastic-apm-symfony-bundle
```

### Step 2: Register the bundle

Then register the bundle with your kernel:

```php
<?php

// in AppKernel::registerBundles()
$bundles = array(
    // ...
    new ElasticApmBundle\ElasticApmBundle(),
    // ...
);
```

### Step 3: Configuring Elastic APM

You should review all the configuration items for the agent extension here, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/php/current/configuration.html. These must be set either through environment variables or `php.ini`. These cannot be set during the request and so the bundle does not support setting them. 

### Step 4: Configure the bundle

The following are all the options you can configure on the bundle.

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml

elastic_apm:
    enabled: true                         # Defaults to true
    logging: false                        # If true, logs all interactions to the Symfony log (default: false)
    interactor: ~                         # The interactor service that is used. Setting enabled=false will override this value 
    deprecations: true                    # If true, reports deprecations to Elastic APM (default: true)
    track_memory_usage: false             # If true, records peak memory usage
    memory_usage_label: memory_usage      # The name of the custom label to write memory usage to
    exceptions:
       enabled: true                      # If true, sends exceptions (default: true)
       should_unwrap_exceptions: false    # If true, will also sends the previous/nested exception (default: false)
       ignored_exceptions:                # List of exception classes to ignore
          - An\Ignored\Exception
    http:
        enabled: true
        transaction_naming: route         # route, controller or service (see below)
        transaction_naming_service: ~     # Transaction naming service (see below)
    commands: 
        enabled: true                     # If true, enhances CLI commands with options and arguments (default: true)
        explicitly_collect_exceptions: true # Turn this off if you are experiencing multiple reports of exceptions.
```

## Enhanced RUM instrumentation

This bundle does not integrate RUM (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/overview.html) as there are a multiple of ways to install and configure the instrumentation.

## Transaction naming strategies

The bundle comes with four built-in transaction naming strategies:
- `route`
- `route-path`
- `controller`
- `uri`
  
Naming the transaction after the route, controller or request URI respectively. However, the bundle supports custom transaction naming strategies through the `service` configuration option. If you have selected the `service` configuration option, you must pass the name of your own transaction naming service as the `transaction_naming_service` configuration option.

The transaction naming service class must implement the `ElasticApmBundle\TransactionNamingStrategy\TransactionNamingStrategyInterface` interface. For more information on creating your own services, see the Symfony documentation on [Creating/Configuring Services in the Container](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/service_container.html#creating-configuring-services-in-the-container).

## Interactor services

The config key`elastic_apm.interactor` will accept a service ID to a service implementing `ElasticApmInteractorInterface`. 
This bundle comes with a few services that may be suitable for you. 

| Configuration value | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `ElasticApmBundle\Interactor\AdaptiveInteractor` | This is the default interactor. It will check once per request if the agent extension is installed or not. | 
| `ElasticApmBundle\Interactor\ElasticApmInteractor` | This interactor communicates with the Elastic APM agent. It is the one decorator that actually does some work. | 
| `ElasticApmBundle\Interactor\BlackholeInteractor` | This interactor silently drops any calls. | 
| `auto` | This value will check if the Elastic APM PHP extension is installed when you build your container. | 

Note that if you set `elastic_apm.enabled: false` you will always use the `BlackholeInteractor` no matter what value 
used for `elastic_apm.interactor`.

## Monolog

The Elastic APM PHP extension does not directly support sending of log entries as anything other than errors. We recommend adding a new log handler and configuring the elasticsearch (or Elastica) client in your application configuration.

Example:

```yaml

# app/config/config.yml

monolog:
  handlers:
     errors_to_elasticsearch:
        type: buffer
        level: error
        handler: elasticsearch
     elasticsearch:
        type: service
        id: 'Monolog\Handler\ElasticsearchHandler'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Exceptions from commands are being recorded multiple times

PHP APM will automatically collect unhandled exceptions. The bundle will also install a listener for command exceptions. Our listener and the default behaviour can conflict which causes this behaviour. 

To fix this you can turn off `explicitly_collect_exceptions` under the `command` configuration node.
